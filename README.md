## Bakko

Bakko is a WIP [Robocode](http://robocode.sourceforge.net) bot. So far, it is not very competitive, though I at least managed
to break the top 100 of the [LiteRumble](http://literumble.appspot.com/Rankings?game=roborumble), currently sitting at
rank 86.

My goal is to eventually break into the top 50 in the general rumble.

#### Gun
Bakko uses a very simple form of [Pattern Matching](http://robowiki.net/wiki/Pattern_Matching) using
Play-It-Forward to determine the enemy's next position. The gun is taken from my previous
and very old bot Pantheist and is in dire need of improvement.

#### Movement
Also building on Pantheist's code, a minimally segmented version of
[Wave Surfing](http://robowiki.net/wiki/Wave_surfing) is used, which in turn was based heavily on
the great [tutorial](http://robowiki.net/wiki/Wave_Surfing_Tutorial) by Voidious.
