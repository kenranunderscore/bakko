##### TODO's and possible improvements

- Graphical debugging information
- Better segmentation when surfing
- Use more data in PM gun (quasi-segmentation)
- Bundle the surfing data into a POJO to reduce the number of lists
- Use a more appropriate data structure for surfing data, as usually only 3 entries are needed
- Refactor the duplicate code in onHitByBullet and onBulletHitBullet
- Switch to self-implemented GoTo surfing?
